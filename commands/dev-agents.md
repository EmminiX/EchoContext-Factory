# ðŸš€ Development Agent Team

Launch specialized development agents to build your project in parallel.

## What This Does

I'll spawn 5 specialized agents to work on different aspects of your project simultaneously:

- **Frontend Agent** - Implements UI components with React/Vue/Angular
- **Backend Agent** - Creates APIs and server logic  
- **Database Agent** - Designs schemas and data models
- **Testing Agent** - Writes comprehensive test suites
- **Documentation Agent** - Creates technical documentation

## Launching Development Agents

First, let me check your project context and then spawn the appropriate agents.

!echo "ðŸ¤– Preparing to launch development agent team..."

Now I'll read your project documentation and spawn specialized agents based on your requirements. The agents will work in parallel to implement different aspects of your project.

Each agent will:
1. Analyze your project requirements
2. Research best practices using MCP tools
3. Generate production-ready code
4. Follow security and accessibility standards

The agents will coordinate to ensure consistent implementation across all components.

Ready to start? I'll now analyze your project and launch the agent team!
