# 🚀 Start Development Command

I'll help bridge the gap between your documentation and actual coding! This command detects existing documentation and provides optimized prompts for Claude Code to begin development.

## 🎯 Starting Development Initiator

Let me check what documentation you have available and help you start coding...

!node lib/development-initiator.js

## 📋 What This Command Does

### 🔍 Automatic Detection
- Scans for existing project documentation (CLAUDE.md, PRD.md, TASKS.md)
- Checks for generated PRP files (Product Requirements Prompts)
- Identifies the best development path based on what's available

### 🎯 Simplified Choices
Presents clear options based on your situation:
- **Project Development** - When you have full project docs from /start-project
- **Feature Implementation** - When you have a PRP from /generate-prp
- **Fresh Start** - When you're starting from scratch

### 🧠 Neurodivergent-Friendly Design
- **One choice at a time** - Never overwhelming
- **Predefined prompts** - No prompt engineering needed
- **Voice announcements** - Audio feedback for each step
- **Clear guidance** - Explicit instructions for Claude Code

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Starting with Project Documentation
```bash
# After running /start-project
/start-development

# System detects CLAUDE.md, PRD.md, TASKS.md
# Presents: "Start building your documented project"
# Generates optimized prompt with all context
```

### Starting with Feature PRP
```bash
# After running /generate-prp
/start-development

# System detects PRP file
# Presents: "Implement your feature from PRP"
# Loads PRP and creates implementation prompt
```

### Starting Fresh
```bash
# No existing documentation
/start-development

# System detects no docs
# Presents: "Start a fresh project with guidance"
# Provides structured prompt for new development
```

## 🌟 Benefits

### For Neurodivergent Users
- **Reduces cognitive load** - No need to craft complex prompts
- **Provides structure** - Clear path from docs to code
- **Eliminates guesswork** - System knows what to do
- **Maintains focus** - One task at a time

### For All Users
- **Saves time** - Instant development start
- **Ensures consistency** - Uses your existing documentation
- **Maximizes context** - Claude Code gets all relevant information
- **Streamlines workflow** - Seamless transition to coding

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Document Detection** - Scans for all available documentation
2. **Scenario Matching** - Determines best development approach
3. **Choice Presentation** - Shows relevant options clearly
4. **Live Research** - Gathers current best practices (if enabled)
5. **Prompt Generation** - Creates optimized instructions with live context
6. **Context Loading** - Includes all relevant documentation
7. **Development Start** - Claude Code begins with full context

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Live Research
By default, the command performs live web research to gather current best practices. This provides the most up-to-date guidance but takes longer to execute.

**To disable live research** (for faster execution):
```bash
export ECHO_LIVE_RESEARCH=false
/start-development
```

**To enable live research** (default):
```bash
export ECHO_LIVE_RESEARCH=true
/start-development
```

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
- Voice announces "Development initiator ready!"
- Clear choices appear based on your documentation
- Live research results appear (if enabled)
- Selected prompt loads with all context included
- Claude Code starts development immediately
- Voice celebrates "Let's build, [YourName]!"
