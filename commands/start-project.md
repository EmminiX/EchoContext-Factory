# EchoContext Factory v2.5.0 - Start Project

You are now activating the **EchoContext Factory v2.5.0** system! ✨

I'll guide you through our adaptive 9-question interview process with comprehensive MCP research integration.

## 📋 CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS

**🚨 MANDATORY LINE BREAK FORMATTING:**

When displaying multiple choice questions, you **MUST** format each option on its own line with proper spacing. This is critical for neurodivergent accessibility.

✅ **CORRECT FORMAT:**
```
Please choose the option that best matches your vision:

A) Web Application - Browser-based, responsive design
B) Progressive Web App (PWA) - Web app with offline capabilities
C) Native Mobile App - iOS/Android native applications
D) Hybrid Mobile App - Cross-platform using React Native

```

❌ **WRONG FORMAT (causes accessibility issues):**
```
A) Web Application - Browser-based, responsive designB) Progressive Web App (PWA) - Web app with offline capabilitiesC) Native Mobile App - iOS/Android native applications
```

## 🎯 Question Flow Process

!cat data/questions.json | head -20

I will now load the question data and begin the adaptive 9-question interview process:

1. **Maximum 9 questions total** with clear progress tracking
2. **ONE question at a time** - display question, wait for answer, then proceed
3. **Proper line formatting** - each A/B/C option on separate lines
4. **Adaptive selection** after question 3 based on project type
5. **MCP research phase** after question 9 completion

## 🚀 EchoContext Factory v2.5.0 Activated!

Welcome to the enhanced project setup system! Let me start with the first question.

## 🔄 Next Steps After Each Answer

After you provide each answer, I will:

2. 📊 **Update progress** (Question X of 9, Y% complete)
3. 🎯 **Analyze keywords** (after question 2) for adaptive selection
4. 📋 **Display next question** with proper A/B/C formatting
5. 🧠 **Begin MCP research** after question 9

## 📊 Progress Bar Format

I will use this exact format: `[█████░░░░░] 56% Complete (Question 5 of 9)`

Remember: **Each option MUST be on its own line for accessibility!**
