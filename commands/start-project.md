# EchoContext Factory v2.5.0 - Start Project

You are now activating the **EchoContext Factory v2.5.0** system! ✨

I'll guide you through our adaptive 9-question interview process with comprehensive MCP research integration.

!cat data/questions.json | head -20

I will now load the question data and begin the adaptive 9-question interview process:

1. **Maximum 9 questions total** with clear progress tracking
2. **ONE question at a time** - display question, wait for answer, then proceed
3. **Proper line formatting** - each A/B/C option on separate lines
4. **Adaptive selection** after question 3 based on project type
5. **MCP research phase** after question 9 completion

## 🚀 EchoContext Factory v2.5.0 Activated!

Welcome to the enhanced project setup system! Let me start with the first question.

## 🔄 Next Steps After Each Answer

After you provide each answer, I will:

3. 🎯 **Analyze keywords** (after question 2) for adaptive selection
4. 📋 **Display next question** with proper A/B/C formatting
5. 🧠 **Begin MCP research** after question 9

## 📊 Progress Bar Format

I will use this exact format: `[█████░░░░░] 56% Complete (Question 5 of 9)`
