# EchoContext Factory - Start Project Command

You are now activating the **EchoContext Factory v2.5.0** system! ‚ú®

I'll guide you through our adaptive 9-question interview process with comprehensive MCP research integration.

```javascript
const { InteractiveQuestionHandler } = require('/Users/emmi/Projects/Context_engineer/EchoContext-Factory/lib/interactive-question-handler');

// Initialize the question handler and start the flow
const questionHandler = new InteractiveQuestionHandler();
const firstQuestion = questionHandler.startFlow();

// Display the first question
console.log('üöÄ EchoContext Factory v2.5.0 Activated!');
console.log('Welcome to the enhanced project setup system!');
console.log(questionHandler.generateQuestionDisplay(firstQuestion));
console.log('---');
console.log('üéØ **New in v2.5.0:** Adaptive question selection based on your responses');
console.log('üß† **MCP Integration:** Context7 + Perplexity research will enhance your project setup');
console.log('‚ôø **Accessibility:** Maximum 9 questions with clear progress tracking');

// Make the question handler available for continued use
global.echoContextHandler = questionHandler;
global.currentQuestion = firstQuestion;
```

## üîÑ How to Continue the Question Flow

After each answer you provide, I'll process it and show you the next question. The system will:

1. **Validate your answer** against the question requirements
2. **Adapt the next questions** based on your project type and description  
3. **Track progress** with a clear progress bar (1-9 questions max)
4. **Use MCP research** to enhance recommendations after question 9

## üìù Answer Format

- **For multiple choice questions:** Simply type the letter (A, B, C, etc.)
- **For text questions:** Type your answer directly
- **For description questions:** Provide as much detail as you'd like
