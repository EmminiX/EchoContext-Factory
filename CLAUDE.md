## Agent Prompting Standards & MCP Integration

### Agent Task Specification Template

When spawning agents for complex tasks, ALWAYS use this precise specification format:

```markdown
# Agent Task Specification

## Objective
[Precise, measurable goal with clear success criteria]

## Context
[Relevant background information, project constraints, and dependencies]

## Required Research Tools
- **MANDATORY**: Use Context7 MCP for comprehensive research and documentation
- **MANDATORY**: Use Perplexity MCP for current best practices and expert insights
- **MANDATORY**: Cross-reference findings between MCP sources for accuracy

## Work Principles
- **Work Smart, Not Hard**: Choose the most efficient approach, avoid over-engineering
- **Think Deeply**: Analyze problems from multiple angles, consider edge cases
- **No Assumptions**: Verify all information through research when uncertain
- **Be Diligent**: Thorough research and careful implementation

## Specific Requirements
- [Detailed deliverables and constraints]
- [Expected output format and structure]
- [Quality standards and validation criteria]

## Uncertainty Protocol
- When uncertain about ANY aspect, IMMEDIATELY use MCP tools or WebSearch
- Document all research sources and rationale for decisions
- Never proceed with assumptions - always verify information
```

### MCP Usage Standards

**Context7 MCP Requirements:**
- Use for comprehensive codebase analysis and documentation research
- Leverage for architectural pattern discovery and best practices
- Essential for understanding complex system integrations

**Perplexity MCP Requirements:**
- Use for current industry standards and emerging best practices
- Essential for security updates and vulnerability research
- Critical for performance optimization and accessibility guidelines

**Quality Validation:**
- Cross-reference findings between Context7 and Perplexity
- Validate research results against official documentation
- Ensure all MCP research is current and applicable to 2025 standards

### Agent Coordination Protocols

**For Lengthy Task Lists (3+ major components):**
1. **Automatic Agent Spawning**: Decompose into specialized agent tasks
2. **Precise Task Distribution**: Each agent gets detailed, non-overlapping objectives
3. **MCP Research Mandate**: All agents MUST use Context7 and Perplexity MCP
4. **Smart Work Enforcement**: Instruct agents to optimize for efficiency and clarity
5. **Deep Thinking Requirements**: Agents must analyze problems thoroughly
6. **No Assumptions Policy**: Verify all information through research

**Agent Communication Standards:**
- Provide exact, actionable task descriptions
- Include all necessary context and constraints
- Specify expected deliverables and quality standards
- Mandate MCP tool usage for research and validation

implementation-[task]-[timestamp].md # Code solutions
validation-[task]-[timestamp].md    # Testing strategies
comprehensive-[task]-[timestamp].md # Integrated reports
```

### Important Implementation Details

**Question Engine Flow (v2.5.0 - Adaptive System):**
1. Load base questions (project_name, project_description, project_type) from `data/questions.json`
2. Start with 3 base questions for all project types
3. **NEW!** Analyze project description using keyword matching
4. **NEW!** Intelligently select 6 adaptive questions based on project type and description
5. **NEW!** Maximum 9 questions total with consistent progress tracking
6. Build comprehensive context with tech stack, features, security requirements

**Multi-Agent Coordination:**
1. Analyze task complexity and decompose into subtasks
2. Create specialized agents based on task type
3. **Mandate MCP Usage**: Ensure ALL agents use Context7 MCP and Perplexity MCP
4. **Enforce Smart Work Principles**: Instruct agents to work efficiently, think deeply, verify assumptions
5. Execute agents in parallel using Claude Code's Task tool
6. Perform live web research with MCP tools and intelligent caching
7. Aggregate results, resolve conflicts, and validate through cross-referencing MCP sources
8. Generate comprehensive markdown files with research backing and source documentation

**Voice Integration:**
- All hooks are executed via uv runner in settings.json
- TTS providers tried in order: ElevenLabs → OpenAI → pyttsx3
- Personalized messages use ENGINEER_NAME from environment
- Factory notifications triggered on TodoWrite and other events

### Factory Security Considerations

- Input validation on all user inputs
- Path protection to prevent unauthorized file access
- Command filtering to block dangerous operations
- OWASP Top 10 2024 compliance built-in
- Audit logging for all security events

### Environment Variables

Required for enhanced functionality:
```bash
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_key_here    # Best voice quality
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here        # Good voice quality  
ENGINEER_NAME=YourName              # Personalization
```

### Hook System

Configured in `settings.json` with these triggers:
- PostToolUse: Cleanup and factory notifications
- Notification: General voice announcements
- Stop: End-of-session voice feedback
- SubagentStop: Multi-agent completion notifications

All hooks use `uv run` for Python execution with proper dependency management.
