## Synthesis Process

### 1. Input Analysis
```markdown
## Research Synthesis Framework

### Sources Analyzed
- Tech Stack Research: [Key findings]
- Architecture Research: [Patterns identified]
- Security Research: [Critical requirements]
- Deployment Research: [Infrastructure needs]

### Cross-Validation Results
- Consensus areas: [Where all agents agree]
- Divergent recommendations: [Where opinions differ]
- Knowledge gaps: [What needs more research]
```

### 2. Conflict Resolution
```markdown
## Resolving Agent Conflicts

When agents provide conflicting recommendations:

1. **Identify the Conflict**
   - Agent A recommends: Microservices
   - Agent B recommends: Monolith
   
2. **Analyze Context**
   - Project size: Small startup
   - Team experience: Limited
   - Timeline: 3 months MVP
   
3. **Synthesized Decision**
   - Start with modular monolith
   - Design for future microservices
   - Clear migration path documented
   
4. **Rationale**
   - Balances immediate needs with future scale
   - Considers team capabilities
   - Provides evolutionary architecture
```

### 3. Document Integration

#### CLAUDE.md Synthesis
```markdown
# Project Context - Synthesized View

## Technology Decisions
Based on comprehensive research across all domains:

### Frontend: React with TypeScript
**Rationale** (synthesized from multiple agents):
- Tech Stack Agent: Strong ecosystem and community
- Security Agent: Type safety reduces vulnerabilities
- Architecture Agent: Component model supports chosen patterns
- Implementation Agent: Team expertise available

**Implementation Approach**:
1. Start with Create React App for quick setup
2. Implement custom webpack config as needed
3. Use strict TypeScript configuration
4. Follow atomic design principles

### Backend: Node.js with Express
**Rationale** (cross-validated findings):
- Full-stack JavaScript reduces context switching
- Extensive middleware ecosystem
- Strong async/await support
- Excellent performance for I/O operations

### Database: PostgreSQL
**Consensus across agents**:
- ACID compliance for data integrity
- JSON support for flexibility
- Proven scalability
- Strong security features
```

## Core Features (Prioritized)

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)
Synthesized from all research inputs:

1. **User Authentication System**
   - Security Agent: OAuth2 + JWT implementation
   - Backend Agent: Passport.js integration
   - Database Agent: Secure user schema
   - Testing Agent: Auth flow test suite

2. **Core Data Models**
   - Database Agent: Normalized schema design
   - Backend Agent: ORM configuration
   - Architecture Agent: Repository pattern
   - Security Agent: Data encryption strategy

### Phase 2: Feature Development (Months 3-4)
Integrated recommendations:

1. **API Development**
   - Architecture: RESTful design
   - Security: Rate limiting and validation
   - Documentation: OpenAPI specification
   - Testing: Contract testing
```

## Synthesis Patterns

### Technology Stack Synthesis
```markdown
## Integrated Technology Recommendations

### Primary Stack
After analyzing all agent inputs:

**Frontend**
- Framework: React 18+ (unanimous recommendation)
- Language: TypeScript 5+ (security + maintainability)
- State: Zustand (simplicity + performance)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (rapid development)

**Backend**
- Runtime: Node.js 20 LTS
- Framework: Express 5 + TypeScript
- ORM: Prisma (type safety + migrations)
- Validation: Zod (schema validation)

**Infrastructure**
- Container: Docker multi-stage builds
- Orchestration: Kubernetes (when scale demands)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana

### Integration Points
All components selected for compatibility:
- TypeScript throughout
- Consistent coding patterns
- Shared validation schemas
- Unified error handling
```

### Implementation Roadmap Synthesis
```markdown
## Synthesized Implementation Plan

### Week 1-2: Foundation
Combining all agent recommendations:
1. Repository setup with all tooling
2. CI/CD pipeline configuration
3. Development environment standardization
4. Initial architecture implementation

### Week 3-4: Core Development
Integrated approach:
1. Authentication system (security-first)
2. Database schema (performance-optimized)
3. API structure (RESTful + GraphQL ready)
4. Frontend scaffolding (component library)

### Week 5-6: Feature Implementation
Parallel development tracks:
- Frontend: UI components + routing
- Backend: Business logic + data layer
- DevOps: Deployment preparation
- Testing: Test suite development

### Week 7-8: Integration & Polish
Final synthesis:
1. System integration testing
2. Performance optimization
3. Security audit
4. Documentation completion
```

## Output Formats

### Executive Summary
```markdown
# Project Implementation Guide - Executive Summary

## Overview
Based on comprehensive multi-agent analysis, we recommend a modern web stack with React/TypeScript frontend and Node.js/Express backend, deployed via Docker with PostgreSQL database.

## Key Decisions
1. **Architecture**: Modular monolith with microservices-ready design
2. **Security**: Zero-trust model with defense in depth
3. **Deployment**: Container-based with CI/CD automation
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test pyramid approach

## Timeline
- MVP: 8 weeks
- Production-ready: 12 weeks
- Full feature set: 16 weeks

## Critical Success Factors
- Team alignment on TypeScript
- Early CI/CD implementation
- Security-first development
- Continuous testing culture
```
