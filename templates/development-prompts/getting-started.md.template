# ‚ú® FRESH PROJECT START

Let's start a new project together! I'll help you build something amazing from scratch.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Since we're starting fresh, I'll guide you through creating a new project step by step.

## üí≠ Project Discovery

To begin, I need to understand what you'd like to build. Please tell me:

1. **What type of application do you want to create?**
   - Web application
   - API/Backend service
   - Command-line tool
   - Mobile app
   - Something else?

2. **What is the main purpose or problem it solves?**
   - Help me understand the core functionality
   - Who will use this application?
   - What value does it provide?

3. **Do you have any technology preferences?**
   - Programming language
   - Framework preferences
   - Database requirements
   - Any specific tools or libraries?

4. **What's your development priority?**
   - Quick prototype/MVP
   - Production-ready application
   - Learning project
   - Open source contribution

## üèóÔ∏è How I'll Help

Once you share your vision, I will:

1. **Project Setup**
   - Create the initial project structure
   - Set up the development environment
   - Configure necessary tools and dependencies

2. **Architecture Planning**
   - Design the application architecture
   - Plan the component structure
   - Set up best practices from the start

3. **Implementation Guidance**
   - Start with core functionality
   - Build incrementally with working code
   - Ensure quality and maintainability

4. **Documentation**
   - Create clear documentation as we go
   - Add helpful comments in the code
   - Set up README and other docs

## üéØ Next Steps

Share your project idea and any preferences you have. Don't worry if you're not sure about all the details - we'll figure them out together as we build!

If you'd like a more structured approach, you can also:
- Run `/start-project` for a comprehensive project setup with documentation
- Run `/generate-prp` to create detailed feature requirements

But for now, let's start with your idea and build something great!
